JDOX is a vim plugin that generates javadoc compatibile comment for c++ function definitions. The main point that differs jdox from similar commenting plugins is that jdox supports comments between arguments, function name and return types.
Example:
/**
 * Function: a_function
 * @author Pawel Prokop
 * @param str 
 * @param number 
 * @return unsigned  int
 * @version 1.0
 */
unsigned 
int  a_function  ( char * str, /* int not_used_anymore, */ unsigned int number) {
